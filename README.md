# Cover To Cover App

A virtual book club application. Users can create an account, find clubs to join, add books for the group to read, comment on the books and start their own club.

## Motivation

Book clubs are a great way to meet new people and be exposed to new things and ideas. I wanted to provide a space where anyone can read books together and discuss them.
